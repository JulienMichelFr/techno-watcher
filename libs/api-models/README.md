# api-models

This library contains shared interfaces between the [Webapp](https://github.com/JulienMichelFr/techno-watcher/tree/main/apps/techno-watcher) and
the [API](https://github.com/JulienMichelFr/techno-watcher/tree/main/apps/api)

Serialization/de-serialization and validation are handled by [class-validator](https://github.com/typestack/class-validator)
and [class-transformer](https://github.com/typestack/class-transformer)

- `.dto.ts` files are used as input for API requests
- `.model.ts` files models
